PyBoxLib
========

PyBoxLib is a Python wrapper of the Fortran version of BoxLib, and is
authored by Matthew Emmett <memmett@unc.edu>.

The `pyboxlib`_ repository on github.com is a mirror of the
``Src/Python`` directory of the official `BoxLib`_ respository.

Overview
========

BoxLib routines are called from Python through the various wrappers in
``src/fboxlib.f90``.  These wrappers are called from Python using the
``ctypes`` Python module (which allows one to load a shared library
and call C callable routines directly).  The wrappers are made C
callable using the ``iso_c_binding`` Fortran module.  Breifly:

1. Python: PyBoxLib: ``pyboxlib/multifab.py`` etc
2. Python: ctypes
3. Fortran: iso_c_binding
4. Fortran: PyBoxLib wrappers: ``src/fboxlib.f90`` etc
5. Fortran: BoxLib

Finally, PyBoxLib exposes FAB arrays as NumPy arrays.  This is done
through the routines in ``src/boxlib_numpy_*``.
